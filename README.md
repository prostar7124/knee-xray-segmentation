**Knee X-Ray Bone Segmentation using U-Net**
Deep Learning Project – CNN Segmentation Model

This repository contains my implementation of a U-Net–based bone segmentation model for knee X-ray images.
The goal of the project is to automatically segment the femur/tibia bone region from medical X-ray scans.

This project was developed as part of the Bone Segmentation Assignment, with training performed on manually annotated masks created by group members.
